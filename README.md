# The Outer Worlds SC Edition Cheat
 A cheat for The Outer Worlds Spacer's Choice Edition

# Current State
Added the base OmegaWare framework and the SDK which was generated with Dumper 7

Done a little bit of fixing for the framework to allow for support of Dumper 7 generated SDKs vs the CheatGear SDKS it only supported before but the FNames namespace and its related functions still do not work at the moment
